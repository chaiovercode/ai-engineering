# AI Agents

Learning to build production-ready AI agents from scratch.

## What's Here

**[foundations/](foundations/)** - Core patterns for building AI agents
- 8 fundamental patterns explained
- Working code examples
- 3 production-ready agents

## Quick Start

```bash
cd foundations
python complete_tutorial.py
```

This runs demos of all 7 core patterns.

## What You'll Learn

1. How LLMs actually work (stateless, context)
2. Tool use (the most important pattern)
3. RAG (document-based context)
4. Orchestration (multiple LLMs working together)
5. Evaluation (quality control)
6. Production architecture

Start with `foundations/` and work through the examples.
