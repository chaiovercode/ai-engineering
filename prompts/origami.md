A hyper-detailed origami sculpture of [CHARACTER], meticulously hand-folded from premium washi paper with visible fiber texture and subtle color gradients. Crisp geometric folds with razor-sharp creases capture the character's iconic silhouette and signature features in an elegant low-poly interpretation. The face must include clearly defined eyes, expressive and recognizable, rendered as folded paper shapes or painted details on the paper surface.

The sculpture displays expert craftsmanship with complex pleating techniques, precise valley and mountain folds, and layered paper depth. Subtle wear marks and natural paper imperfections add authenticity.

Studio photography setup: placed on a seamless matte white surface, illuminated by soft diffused key light from above-left with gentle fill light. Delicate shadows define the dimensional form. Shallow depth of field with tack-sharp focus on the subject, slight bokeh on edges.

Style: minimalist Japanese paper art aesthetic, museum-quality collectible piece, photorealistic macro photography. Shot with 85mm lens, f/2.8 aperture.
